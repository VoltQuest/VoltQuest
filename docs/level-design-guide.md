## ðŸ’¡ Example Chapter

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Electronics

> Goal: Teach absolute basics â€” current flow, circuit completion, using LEDs, switches, and batteries.

#### Level 1 â€” Powering an LED

- **Objective**: Connect a battery and LED to light it up.
- **Concept**: Closed circuit, polarity of components.
- **Design Tips**:
  - Give only one LED and one battery to prevent confusion.
  - Add visual indicator when LED is placed backwards (dimmed or crossed out).
- **Player Hint**:
  - "Electricity flows only through a complete path!"
- **Additional Notes**:
  - Use this level to reinforce concept visually â€” maybe simulate current flow when correct.
