## üéØ How You Can Help

This project is still early, and there's a lot of room to shape it.  
If you're into electronics, game dev, or education, feel free to get involved.

### Level Design Ideas

- **Beginner**: LED patterns, basic resistor math, voltage drops  
- **Intermediate**: Capacitor timing, transistor switches, waveform tracing  
- **Advanced**: Microcontroller logic, sensor data processing, PCB challenges

## üéÆ What VoltQuest Is About

VoltQuest is all about exploring electronics through play. Instead of reading theory, you get to build, test, and tweak circuits yourself ‚Äî seeing how components behave in real time.

It‚Äôs designed to be approachable whether you‚Äôre just starting out or already comfortable with electronics. The game gradually introduces new parts and challenges, letting you grow your skills at your own pace.

The goal is to make electronics less intimidating and more fun, by turning learning into an interactive experience. No boring lectures, just hands-on experimenting.
